# Sudoku Solver

This is a Python program that solves Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm. Simply input the Sudoku puzzle as a 2D array with 0s representing empty cells, and the program will find a solution if one exists.

## Usage

1. Define your Sudoku puzzle by editing the `board` variable in the Python script. Use a 2D list where 0 represents empty cells, and other numbers represent known values.

2. Run the Python script. If a solution exists, it will be printed to the console.

Example Sudoku board:
```python
board = [
    [0, 0, 4, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [2, 0, 5, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0],
    # ... (complete the board)
]


4. **Explain the Algorithm:** You can provide a brief explanation of the backtracking algorithm used in your program. This will help users understand how the solver works.

```
## Algorithm

The program uses a backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles. It iterates through the empty cells, tries placing numbers from 1 to 9, and checks for validity. If a valid number is found, it moves on to the next empty cell. If a solution cannot be found, it backtracks to the previous cell and tries a different number. This process continues until a solution is found or determined to be impossible.
